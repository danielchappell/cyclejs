/**
 * `isolate` takes a small component as input, and returns a big component.
 * A "small" component is a component that operates in a deeper scope.
 * A "big" component is a component that operates on a scope that
 * includes/wraps/nests the small component's scope. This is specially true for
 * isolation contexts such as onionify.
 *
 * Notice that we type BigSo/BigSi as any. This is unfortunate, since ideally
 * these would be generics in `isolate`. TypeScript's inference isn't strong
 * enough yet for us to automatically provide the typings that would make
 * `isolate` return a big component. However, we still keep these aliases here
 * in case TypeScript's inference becomes better, then we know how to proceed
 * to provide proper types.

/**
 * Takes a `component` function and a `scope`, and returns an isolated version
 * of the `component` function.
 *
 * When the isolated component is invoked, each source provided to it is
 * isolated to the given `scope` using `source.isolateSource(source, scope)`,
 * if possible. Likewise, the sinks returned from the isolated component are
 * isolated to the given `scope` using `source.isolateSink(sink, scope)`.
 *
 * The `scope` can be a string or an object. If it is anything else than those
 * two types, it will be converted to a string. If `scope` is an object, it
 * represents "scopes per channel", allowing you to specify a different scope
 * for each key of sources/sinks. For instance
 *
 * ```js
 * const childSinks = isolate(Child, {DOM: 'foo', HTTP: 'bar'})(sources);
 * ```
 *
 * You can also use a wildcard `'*'` to use as a default for source/sinks
 * channels that did not receive a specific scope:
 *
 * ```js
 * // Uses 'bar' as the isolation scope for HTTP and other channels
 * const childSinks = isolate(Child, {DOM: 'foo', '*': 'bar'})(sources);
 * ```
 *
 * If a channel's value is null, then that channel's sources and sinks won't be
 * isolated. If the wildcard is null and some channels are unspecified, those
 * channels won't be isolated. If you don't have a wildcard and some channels
 * are unspecified, then `isolate` will generate a random scope.
 *
 * ```js
 * // Does not isolate HTTP requests
 * const childSinks = isolate(Child, {DOM: 'foo', HTTP: null})(sources);
 * ```
 *
 * If the `scope` argument is not provided at all, a new scope will be
 * automatically created. This means that while **`isolate(component, scope)` is
 * pure** (referentially transparent), **`isolate(component)` is impure** (not
 * referentially transparent). Two calls to `isolate(Foo, bar)` will generate
 * the same component. But, two calls to `isolate(Foo)` will generate two
 * distinct components.
 *
 * ```js
 * // Uses some arbitrary string as the isolation scope for HTTP and other channels
 * const childSinks = isolate(Child, {DOM: 'foo'})(sources);
 * ```
 *
 * Note that both `isolateSource()` and `isolateSink()` are static members of
 * `source`. The reason for this is that drivers produce `source` while the
 * application produces `sink`, and it's the driver's responsibility to
 * implement `isolateSource()` and `isolateSink()`.
 *
 * _Note for Typescript users:_ `isolate` is not currently type-transparent and
 * will explicitly convert generic type arguments to `any`. To preserve types in
 * your components, you can use a type assertion:
 *
 * ```ts
 * // if Child is typed `Component<Sources, Sinks>`
 * const isolatedChild = isolate( Child ) as Component<Sources, Sinks>;
 * ```
 *
 * @param {Function} component a function that takes `sources` as input
 * and outputs a collection of `sinks`.
 * @param {String} scope an optional string that is used to isolate each
 * `sources` and `sinks` when the returned scoped component is invoked.
 * @return {Function} the scoped component function that, as the original
 * `component` function, takes `sources` and returns `sinks`.
 * @function isolate
